    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This crab rangoon casserole, a noodle casserole with surimi in a creamy, cheesy sauce, and topped with crisp wonton chips, is as rich and delicious as your favorite crab Rangoon appetizer.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound wide egg noodles</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 pound surimi crab legs, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>8 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>8 ounces wonton chips</li>
        <li>1 bunch green onions, sliced</li>
        <li>sweet chili sauce, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat, add egg noodles, and cook until tender with a bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain; set aside.</li>
        <li>Add butter, heavy cream, and cream cheese to a saucepan, place over medium heat, and cook, stirring, until sauce is smooth, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add noodles to the prepared casserole dish; top with crab and half of mozzarella. Pour sauce on top and stir to combine. Smooth out the mixture and top with remaining cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is golden brown and bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes. Garnish with wonton chips, green onions and sweet chili sauce if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
